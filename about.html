    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I'm a Web Development Enthusiast who loves turning ideas into interactive, user-friendly websites. I'm currently taking a Web development course where I'm learning the core building blocks of the web - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I didn't start with a tech background, but my curiousity and drive to learn have led me here. I've been exploring the magic behind websites, one tag, one style, and one function at a time. With every project, I'm gaining not just technical skills but also confidence in my ability to solve problems and bring creative visions to life.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Outside of coding, I enjoy reading about tech trends, watching tutorials, and collaborating with fellow learners. My goal is to become a Professional Full stack developer who creates experiences that are not only functional but also delightful.</p>
