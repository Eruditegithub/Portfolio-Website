    <h1>Skills I'm Building</h1>
    <p>As I continue my learning journey, I'm steadily gaining hands-on experience tools and technologies. Here's what I've picked up so far.</p>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>HTML5:</strong> Creating well-structured and semantic web pages that are easy to read and maintain.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>CSS3:</strong> Styling pages with responsive layouts, animations, and a touch of creativity to enhance user experience.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> Making websites interactive - handling user inputs, dynamic content, and basic DOM Manipulation.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Git & GitHub:</strong> Tracking changes in my code and collaborating using version control. I regularly push my projects to GitHub to showcase my work.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> Ensuring my sites look great on my device - Phones, tablets, or desktops.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Problem Solving:</strong> Debugging errors, finding solutions, and learning from every mistake.</li>
    </ul>
